## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Modify `backend/internal/worker/executor/executor.go` to increment `alert_count` by 1 instead of `originalLogCount`
- [x] 1.2 Update `Requirement: Rule Statistics` in `specs/rule-management/spec.md` to state that `alert_count` represents execution count
- [x] 1.3 Add scenario demonstrating alert_count calculation as execution count
