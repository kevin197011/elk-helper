## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Modify `backend/internal/service/alert/alert.go` to ensure time range uses actual current time (not aligned) for query boundary
- [x] 1.2 Update `Requirement: Chart Data Aggregation` in `specs/dashboard/spec.md` to explicitly state time range is from current time minus 24 hours
- [x] 1.3 Add scenario demonstrating precise 24-hour time range from current time
